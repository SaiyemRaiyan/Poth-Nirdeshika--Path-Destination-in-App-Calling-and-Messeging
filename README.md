# Poth Nirdeshika - Path Destination in app calling and messeging 
                                                    Introduction
“Poth Nirdeshika” is a multi platform web based project which provides the users with systematic information regarding path, road and so on about one place to another. For example it can show all possible ways and optimal paths to anyone. As a result, any person can easily move from one place to another without hassle. Experts can fill a form in here so that their databases are included in the form and general people can reach them if they are unable or face problems finding their desired path. Moreover, users will be able to see the all possible way via google map. Most importantly, they are able to call or message any expert in any kind of location. By cross discussion with experts and their suggestions could be better and trustworthy for users.                               


                                                    Problem Statement
This problem demonstrates what we faced while using Google Maps. For example, if we want to
visit a specific zone, we search on google Maps for the location or else the shortest path to arrive
there. But the major problem we face is that Google Maps can’t be able to show us the exact path
that we want to go through. Sometimes a map shows a path over the water or in a blocked path.
The people going through the shown path may face problems. For that, we want to contact an
experienced person who visited the specific path earlier. But this kind of feature is not available
on the map.
Basically, in google map users can show the location when a user enters a starting point and
destination, Google Maps utilizes a routing algorithm to determine the optimal route based on
factors such as distance, traffic conditions, and transportation modes. Google maps also provide
direction, street view and traffic information. But the problem is the Google map is unable to
show the all possible optimal path without a barrier.
